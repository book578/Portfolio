Portfolio of projects and sample programs to showcase


project#2.sh is a shell script written to process through over 100,000 files on  machine to obtain key data from each file. Collect it in an array, obtain averages and generate a plot from the averaged data points.


Added proj4.py to repo. Proj4.py has same functionality as project#2.sh except that proj4.py is written in python and plots the graphs to a single pdf.

Safed.sh creates a directory in /home directory called Trash. Safely deletes a file by running command to move a file to Trash directory, and if any file is older than 1 day it will permanently delete such files.


Added breadth first search project to Github. Using C++ and creating my own implementation of a double ended queue, utilizing a breadth first search algorithm to find the closest exit in any maze.
