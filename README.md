project#2.sh is a shell script written to process through over 100,000 files on  machine to obtain key data from each file. Collect it in an array, obtain averages and generate a plot from the averaged data points.


Added proj4.py to repo. Proj4.py has same functionality as project#2.sh except that proj4.py plots the graphs to a single pdf.
